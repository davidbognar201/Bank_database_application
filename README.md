# Banking CRUD Application

This project was an assignment on one of the Software Development course that I took during my university studies.

My main goal was to build an application which stores data about customers and their products, so users can easily get a wide range of information about all, or just a given customer.

The original repository was properly version controlled with Git since the start of the project, but that repository is private because it had to contain private information about the course, so this is just a modified version without those details.

Due to the nature of the project, there were several restrictions that had to be respected. One of them was that the application must be build in .NET Core 5 and only Console Application were accepted. In the future I'm planning to develop a more appealing GUI for the application with JavaScript.
